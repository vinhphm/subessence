## About

First of, this theme was supposed to be only for my personal use, but later (after coming to the conclusion that some people might find it useful) I've decided to share it. It has helped me increase my productivity a lot, hope it will do for you too.

It is basically a subjectively revamped version of awesome [Subliminal Next](https://github.com/gaearon/subliminal) theme made by [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon).
